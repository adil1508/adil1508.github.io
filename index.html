                        <h2>Photo filtering Android app</h2>
                        <p>
                            This was a simple application that fetched some pictures over the internet, displayed them and allowed the user to filter images by assigned ratings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This app was a first of a lot of things. First time building a fully functional android app. First time designing the entire UI. First time using Android's activity framework.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The application was written in Java. It consisted of 2 activities. One for displaying a grid of images and the other to enlarge and display that image on the entire screen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The UI was designed mainly using the Android Studio's built-in UI GUI, with some small manual XML changes to specify the layout. 
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2 >Breakout</h2>
                            <p>
                                This fun little project was a fully playable clone of the game Breakout, complete with a colorful GUI and a scoring system.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The application was written using C++ and XLibraries. This was my first attempt in dealing with User-Computer interaction. I had never before created GUIs or dealt with event loops in so direct a manner as I did when coding this.
                            </p>

                                <p>
                                    My first experience writing a video game! I was a member of the 3 person team responsible for creating this clone of Rogue for the terminal.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The entire application was written in C++. I was also responsible for the initial software architecture before any actual code was written. Various design patterns were used in the OOP architecture to make the game easier to code while making it extensible.
                                </p>
                                <p>PS. Our initial version was too hard to win so we also put in some secret cheat codes that only the developers know ;)</p>

                                An application written when learning Java and creating GUIs using its Swing library. There some important concepts implemented behind the scenes including Scene graphs, widget layouts, event listeners (and adapters), etc.

                            This application is a working clone of typical Paint applications. It only implements a subset of the features but is still powerful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The application logic was written in Java and the GUI was designed and created using its lightweight Swing library. This was the first time I had used the Swing library or Java to write a full application, or even create a GUI.

                        <p>At heart, I am an engineer. I absolutely love to build things! I love to learn about the latest and greatest the tech world has to offer. My goal in life is to architect and engineer meaningul software that helps to solve the many problems we currently face.</p>
                        <p>I am an extremely driven, passionate and resilient individual. In Summer 2015, I was diagnosed with a rare subtype of Leaukemia. That was the single greatest battle I have ever fought in my life. It put my life on hold for 2 years but I braved it through and came back with more gratitude, passion and an undying hunger for knowledge!</p>
                        <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelors of Computer Science(Software Engineering Option) from the University of Waterloo. I expect to graduate end of 2020.</p>
                        <p>
                        Apart from writing code, I love to play guitar. I fell in love with the instrument in high school and have been practicing and improving ever since. (For the guitar people: I currently own a PRS SE Custom 24 :D)
                        </p>
                        <p>I also really enjoy running and working out. I am training to run a half-marathon someday. I am also big into video games. I love the aspect of a 'playable' story. It is a great way to relax.</p>
